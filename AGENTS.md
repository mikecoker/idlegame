# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Source assets live in `assets/`. TypeScript gameplay scripts are under `assets/game` (for example `Simulator.ts`, `UICharacter.ts`, and domain models such as `character.ts` and `stat.ts`). Player presets and similar JSON data live in `assets/data`, while Cocos prefabs reside in `assets/prefabs`. The `library/`, `temp/`, `profiles/`, and `settings/` directories are generated by Cocos Creator to cache editor state; do not edit or version-control files there manually.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
This project targets Cocos Creator 3.8. Launch the editor with the project open using `CocosCreator --path .` or use the GUI to select this folder. From the editor you can press **Play** to preview, or trigger a platform build via **Project â†’ Build**. Headless preview: `CocosCreator --path . --preview`. TypeScript compilation is handled by the editor through `temp/tsconfig.cocos.json`; no additional npm scripts are required.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Keep the existing two-space indentation, trailing semicolons, and double-quoted imports. Use PascalCase for Cocos components (`Simulator`, `UIStatLine`) and camelCase for properties (`characterOneData`). Decorate serializable fields with `@property` annotations to expose them in the editor. Keep data-only JSON under `assets/data`. Follow the ES2017 target defined in `tsconfig.json` and avoid enabling strict mode unless you plan to address the resulting errors.

## Testing Guidelines
There is no automated test suite yet. Exercise new logic by launching the default scene in the Cocos preview, monitor console output (e.g., damage logs from `Simulator.doTurn()`), and verify UI bindings via the simulator. When bugs are fixed, describe manual reproduction steps in the pull request so reviewers can repeat them quickly.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Use concise, descriptive, sentence-case commit messages (existing history favors short imperatives such as `switch to the desktop`). Group related scene, script, and asset changes together so the `.meta` files stay in sync. Pull requests should summarize the gameplay or UI impact, note any schema changes to JSON data, attach screenshots or short clips for visual updates, and reference tracking issues where applicable.

## Asset Management Tips
Let Cocos Creator regenerate `.meta` files and UUID links; avoid manual edits. Keep shared values (stats, items) in JSON for easier diffing. When importing new art or prefabs, place sources in `assets/` and confirm their UUIDs remain stable before committing.
